this app is based on blue-green deployment of a simple go web app

what I did is simply created 2 seperate go web app and dockerise them after this created an kube cluster for the load balancers or the ingress fucntion 

deployed the apps using the yaml files (at this point I understand them not completly but most of it) after the deployment of the app service you need to create 

diffrent versions and deploy them seperately. after this it should work like the problem statement sorry for the inconvinence as my AWS account got suspended for non payment.
