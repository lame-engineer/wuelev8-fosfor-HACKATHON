At this point I thank from bottom of my heart to WUElev8 team for providing me this oppourtunity it was an woderful expirence as this was my first Hack-A-Thon

sorry If I didn't performed as you expected but I gave my 100% to it, I explained my approach seperately to the respected folders, I got to learn a lot

as this was my not very first but a direct experince in kubernetes and I'm in love with it. I will definitely improve more and more in the coming days its complex but not that much

Anyways I'm open for further discussion if you need to know more.
