Tried my best to learn kubernetes as I'm fairly new to this service i reffered to kubesphere for this task.
fist we need to fire some commands to initiate the kubernetes

kubectl create ns ingress-demo

then to apply each yml file to get to the pods

kubectl apply -f production.yaml -n ingress-demo

it should look like this

I'm very happy that I learned a lot in such a short time, thanks for this oppourtunity guys.
